This hardware project is the reference schematic for the [nRF8001] Bluetooth Low Energy chip redone in Eagle. It is currently untested. The goal of this project is to develop a low power, cheap, cross-platform wireless module for wireless projects. I plan to include open firmware and demos for iOS and Android. Checkout my [blog post] for more info.

Why nRF8001 and not another [Bluetooth 4 chip]?

* Publicly available datasheet
* Simple circuitry, few passives and no integrated uC
* Cheap, $4.98 CAD on [Mouser]
* Small, currently the board is 1’’ x 0.9’’

Interesting Bluetooth 4 facts:

* Runs for years on a coin cell battery
* Works over a wide range; 10 to 100 meters
* 1Mbps over the air data rate; 0.2 Mbps throughput 
* Virtually all new devices made in 2012 will contain Bluetooth 4 
* Apple only provides a free API for Bluetooth 4 accessories
