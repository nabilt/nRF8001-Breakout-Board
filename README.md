This hardware project is the reference schematic for the [nRF8001] Bluetooth Low Energy chip redone in Eagle. It is currently untested. The goal of this project is to develop a low power, cheap, cross-platform wireless module for wireless projects. I plan to include open firmware and demos for iOS and Android.

Why nRF8001 and not another Bluetooth 4 chips?

Publicly available datasheet
Simple circuitry, no integrated uC for e.g.
Cheap, $4.98 CAD on [Mouser]
Small, currently the board is 1’’ x 0.9’’

Interesting Bluetooth 4 facts:

Runs for years on a coin cell battery
Works over a wide range; 10 to 100 meters
1Mbps over the air data rate; 0.2 Mbps throughput 
Virtually all new devices made in 2012 will contain Bluetooth 4 
Apple only provides a free API for Bluetooth 4 accessories
